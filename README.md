# ECG Heartbeat Classification using Convolution Neural Networks
## Description 
- ECG or Electrocardiogram is an record of electrical signal from your heart to check for different heart conditions. sometimes it can be normal or abnormal so, we build and CNN model with 3 different architectures to classify 
types of ECG
## Dataset
- Our dataset is obtained from Kaggle which is about "550 MB" it is time-series data for different types of heartbeat " API For Data is inserted For Downloading"
## Requirements
- Google Colab -- For Training CNN
- Keras -- to build CNN Layers
